Wen-Pin Hsieh's paper, co-authored by Alex Goncharov, Nicholas
Holtgrewe, Sergey S. Lobanov, Irina Chuvashova, Frédéric Deschamps,
Jung-Fu Lin and myself is published in *Nature
Communications*. Wen-Pin and his colleagues made new measurements of
thermal conductivity of Fe-Si alloys and obtained values much lower
than some previously published results. The debate is still going on
but, clearly, such low values of the conductivity allow the geodynamo
to run on heat for most of its history without the need for a very high
initial temperature. You can read the paper on the
[journal's webpage](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17106-7).
