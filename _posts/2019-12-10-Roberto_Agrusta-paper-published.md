Roberto Agrusta's paper, co-authored by Adrien Morison, Renaud Deguen,
Thierry Alboussi√®re, Paul Tackley, Fabien Dubuffet and myself just got
published in the *Geophysical Journal International*. This paper
presents results of a systematic investigation of convection in a
solid planetary mantle, modeled as a plane two-dimensional layer,
bounded above and/or below by a magma ocean.
