With Laëtitia Lebec, as part of her PhD the PhD she defende last
september, published two papers in Icarus on convection in high
pressure (HP) ice layers in large icy satellites and water worlds. 

The [first paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103523000714?via%3Dihub)
considers the effect of the solid-liquid phase change on convection in
the solid and proposes scaling relationships for the temperature
difference across the layer as function of the Rayleigh
number. Applications to Titan or Ganymede show that convection in
these layers is quite efficient and that the ice is expected to melt,
at least partially, in contact with the rocky core.

The [second paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103524000241?via%3Dihub)
adds the effects of salts entering the ice layers from the underlying
rocky core. The ice-salt mixture is expected to be denser than pure
water ice which could impede convection. This effect is quantified
using a buoyancy number which compares the negative buoyancy of salts
to the positive buoyancy contribution from temperature variations. For
large values of the buoyancy number, a stable layer of salt-rich ice
develops at the bottom of the ice layer but convection proceeds
largely unaffected in the upper salts-poor layer, with a limited but
significant entrainement of salts from the lower layer to the
overlying ocean.
