Mathieu Bouffard's paper, co-authored by GaÃ«l Choblet, Johannes Wicht
and myself, just got published in *Frontiers in Earth Science*.
This paper presents some results of a model of purely compositional
convection at infinite Schmidt number (no diffusion) in a rotating
spherical shell driven by the release of light elements at the lower
boundary. This situation is inspired by that of Earth's core although
the present paper does not consider the effect of thermal convection
of the magnetic field. One of the results is the **self-consistent
development of a stably stratified layer at the top of the shell by
accumulation of light elements** released from the bottom, possibly
explaining observations from seismology and geomagnetism.
