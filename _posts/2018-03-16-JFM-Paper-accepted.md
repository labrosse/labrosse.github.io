Our paper on convection in a solid plane layer with phase change at either or both horizontal boundaries has been accepted for
publication in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics. We present results from linear and weakly non-linear analysis of the problem and show
that the possibility of melting and freezing at the boundaries make convection a lot easier, i.e. possible with a much lower Rayleigh number. The wavelength of the solution is also much larger than in the classical situation and the heat flux (Nusselt number) increases
more rapidly with the Rayleigh number. For the details, si the submitted version on [&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00791">arXiv</a>]. This paper is part of the [MaCoMaOc project](/MaCoMaOc/).
