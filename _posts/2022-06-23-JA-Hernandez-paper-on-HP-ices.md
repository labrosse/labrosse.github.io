With Jean-Alexis and Razvan, we published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30796-5)
in *Nature Communications* about the solubility of salts in HP ices. We show, using first-principles simulations,
that up to 2.5â€‰wt% NaCl can be dissolved in dense water ice at interior conditions of water-rich super-Earths
and mini-Neptunes. Using scaling laws for convection in such layers, we show that significant transfer of salts
can occur between the rocky cores and the overlying ocean, which should help for their habitability.
