Renaud Deguen's paper, co-authored by Thierry Alboussi√®re and myself, presents results from linear stability analysis and direct numerical models of double-diffusive convection in Earth's inner core. Convection can happen if a destabilizing compositional gradient is established in the inner core during its formation, even if the temperature field is stabilizing. Get all the details in [<a href='https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggy120'>the paper</a>]!
