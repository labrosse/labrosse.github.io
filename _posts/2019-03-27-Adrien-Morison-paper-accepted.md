Adrien Morison's paper, co-authored by Renaud Deguen, Thierry
Alboussi√®re and myself, just got accepted for publication in Earth and
Planetary Sciences Letters. In this paper, we compute the timescale of
overturn in a solid mantle cristallising from a magma ocean. We show
that the overturn, driven both by the temperature and composition
unstable stratification, happens much faster than the time required to
freeze the magma ocean. Therefore, solid-state mantle convection must
have started before full crystallisation. Moreover, allowing for phase
change between the solid mantle and the magma ocean makes the degree
one the preferred mode of overturn. This could explain the Moon or
Mars dichotomy. This paper is part of the [MaCoMaOc Project](/MaCoMaOc).
