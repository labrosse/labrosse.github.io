With Thierry Alboussière, Yanick Ricard, Jezabel Curbelo, and Fabien
Dubuffet, we just published two companion papers on compressible
convection. Each uses a different equation of state and results using
fully compressible equations are compared to classical approximations
(anelastic, anelastic liquid, Boussinesq). The numerical solutions are
obtained using the [dedalus software](https://dedalus-project.org/)
and the scripts are available on
(github)[https://github.com/RayleighBenardModels]. The papers are
