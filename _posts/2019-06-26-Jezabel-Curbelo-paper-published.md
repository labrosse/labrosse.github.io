Jezabel Curbelo's paper, co-authored by Lucia Duarte, Thierry
Alboussi√®re, Fabien Dubuffet, Yanick Ricard and myself, just got published in *Journal of
Fluid Mechanics*. This paper presents a systematic comparison of
convection solutions in an infinite Prandtl number fluid computed with
full compressible equations, the anelastic approximation and the
anelastic liquid approximation.
