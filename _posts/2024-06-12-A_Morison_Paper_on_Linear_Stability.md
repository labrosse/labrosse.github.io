Thermal convection in planetary solid (rocky or icy) mantles sometimes
occurs adjacent to liquid layers with a phase equilibrium at the
boundary. The possibility of a solid–liquid phase change at the
boundary has been shown to greatly help convection in the solid layer
in spheres and plane layers and a similar study is performed here for
a spherical shell with a radius-independent central gravity subject to
a destabilizing temperature difference. The solid–liquid phase change
is considered as a mechanical boundary condition and applies at either
or both horizontal boundaries. The boundary condition is controlled by
a phase change number, Φ, that compares the timescale for latent heat
exchange in the liquid side to that necessary to build a topography at
the boundary. We introduce a numerical tool, available on
[github](https://github.com/amorison/stablinrb), to carry out the
linear stability analysis of the studied setup as well as other
similar situations (Cartesian geometry, arbitrary temperature and
viscosity depth-dependent profiles). Decreasing Φ makes the phase
change more efficient, which reduces the importance of viscous
resistance associated to the boundary and makes the critical Rayleigh
number for the onset of convection smaller and the wavelength of the
critical mode larger, for all values of the radii ratio, γ. In
particular, for a phase change boundary condition at the top or at
both boundaries, the mode with a spherical harmonics degree of 1 is
always favoured for Φ ≲ 10<sup>−1</sup>. Such a mode is also favoured for a phase
change at the bottom boundary for small (γ ≲ 0.45) or large (γ ≳ 0.75)
radii ratio. Such dynamics could help explaining the hemispherical
dichotomy observed in the structure of many planetary objects.
