Previous studies focusing on the electrical conductivity and thermal
evolution of an early magma ocean at the base of Earth’s mantle have
found that basal magma ocean (BMO) convection could have produced the
ancient geomagnetic field. By advances in high-resolution dynamo
modeling, we find that convection in a thin BMO-like spherical shell
is able to sustain strong magnetic fields, including axial dipolar
fields similar to current day field structure. However, integrating
our dynamo results with improved thermal evolution models and taking
the planet’s rapid rotation into account using rotating convective
turbulence models implies that an Earth-like magnetic field was
unlikely to have been generated in the BMO, a finding relevant to the
interpretation of ancient paleomagnetic signatures, Earth’s
global-scale dynamics, and long-term planetary evolution. Large
uncertainties still remain, calling for refined models of deep Earth
thermal and mineralogical processes, accurate determination of
prefactors in convective scaling laws, and fully coupled core-BMO
dynamo simulations. Nonetheless, our work highlights that BMO-type
dynamos intrinsically require a larger product of electrical
conductivity and velocity than core-type dynamos, and that they are
similarly rotationally constrained, so that velocities are
significantly reduced compared to nonrotating estimates.
