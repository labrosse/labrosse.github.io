Our paper on convection in a solid plane layer with melting and
freezing at either or both horizontal boundaries has been published in
the *Journal of Fluid Mechanics*. We present results from linear and
weakly non-linear analysis of the problem and show that the
possibility of melting and freezing at the boundaries make convection
a lot easier, i.e. possible with a much lower Rayleigh number. The
wavelength of the solution is also much larger than in the classical
situation and the heat flux (Nusselt number) increases more rapidly
with the Rayleigh number. For the details, see the
