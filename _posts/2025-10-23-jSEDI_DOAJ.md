As of April 2025, the journal of Studies of Earth's Deep Interior,
jSEDI, is open for submission of research papers on planetary deep
interiors. The third paper just got published today! 

jSEDI is a diamond access open journal (DOAJ) which means that it is
free of charge for both authors and readers. This journal is an
overlay journal: the authors first upload their paper to an open
archive ([Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [HAL](https://hal.science/) or
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)) and then submit it on the [jSEDI
website](https://jsedi.episciences.org/). It is then handled by one
of the editors, like in any research journal. After rounds of
peer-review and corrections, the authors upload their accepted final version to
the same open archive and jSEDI points to that archived pdf. 
A LaTeX template is provided to prepare the final version of the paper
and the handling editor checks its conformity to the journal's
standards. If you are not confortable using LaTeX, don't worry, it is
quite easy. You can use [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to avoid
installing LaTeX on your computer. If you prepared your paper using
word, you may try to ask your favorite large language model to make a
LaTeX version using our template. 

The journal website is hosted by
[https://www.episciences.org/](Episciences) and published by [ENS
Éditions](https://catalogue-editions.ens-lyon.fr/). It is operated by
a team of editors working voluntarily. For any question regarding the
journal, do not hesitate to contact me or any other editor.

See the published papers and submit your own on the [jSEDI
website](https://jsedi.episciences.org/).
