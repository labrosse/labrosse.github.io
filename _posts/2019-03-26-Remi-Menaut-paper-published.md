Rémi Menaut's paper, co-authored by Yoann Corre, Ludovic Huguet,
Thomas Le Reun, Thierry Alboussière, Michael Bergman, Renaud Deguen,
Stéphane Labrosse and Marc Moulin, presents results from a set of
experiments on compressible convection. A centrifuge is used to reach
high gravity and the fluid is pressurized Xenon, in order to maximize
the isentropic temperature gradient. Even though the convective
chamber is only 4 cm deep, the isentropic temperature gradient is
measurable. You can get all the details on
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04572) or the [journal website](https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.4.033502).
