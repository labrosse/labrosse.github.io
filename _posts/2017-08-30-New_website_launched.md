I got a bit fed up with my old website using a CMS, which a bit
annoying to maintain. I thought I would give a try to
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), use Markdown for all pages and
posts. I used the
[Minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/),
which seems like a good way to go ;-). 
The bibliography is converted automatically to html from bib
using [bibtex2html](https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html/) with:
```
bibtex2html -d -r --revkeys --both --html-entities --nobibsource --nodoc mybib.bib
```

I am not sure I will keep up with the blogging thing but at least to
make static pages, this is simple enough! Nothing too fancy here but
you should find the minimum info.
