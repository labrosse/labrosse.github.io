Thomas Frasson's first paper about true polar wander implied by mantle
convection and its effect on the evolution of the CMB heat flow
pattern got publised in *Solid Earth*. Here is the abstract:

The heat flux across the core–mantle boundary (CMB) is a fundamental
variable for Earth evolution and internal dynamics. Seismic tomography
provides access to seismic heterogeneities in the lower mantle, which
can be related to present-day thermal heterogeneities. Alternatively,
mantle convection models can be used to either infer past CMB heat
flux or to produce statistically realistic CMB heat flux patterns in
self-consistent models. Mantle dynamics modifies the inertia tensor of
the Earth, which implies a rotation of the Earth with respect to its
spin axis, a phenomenon called true polar wander (TPW). This rotation
must be taken into account to link the dynamics of the mantle to the
dynamics of the core. In this study, we explore the impact of TPW on
the CMB heat flux over long timescales (∼1 Gyr) using two recently
published mantle convection models: one model driven by a plate
reconstruction and a second that self-consistently produces a
plate-like behaviour. We compute the geoid in both models to correct
for TPW. In the plate-driven model, we compute a total geoid and a
geoid in which lateral variations of viscosity and density are
suppressed above 350 km depth. An alternative to TPW correction is
used for the plate-driven model by simply repositioning the model in
the original paleomagnetic reference frame of the plate
reconstruction. The average TPW rates range between 0.4 and
1.8°/Myr, but peaks up to 10°/Myr are observed. We find that in
the plate-driven mantle convection model used in this study, the
maximum inertia axis produced by the model does not show a long-term
consistency with the position of the magnetic dipole inferred from
paleomagnetism. TPW plays an important role in redistributing the CMB
heat flux, notably at short timescales (≤10 Myr). Those rapid
variations modify the latitudinal distribution of the CMB heat flux,
which is known to affect the stability of the magnetic dipole in
geodynamo simulations. A principal component analysis (PCA) is
computed to obtain the dominant CMB heat flux pattern in the different
cases. These heat flux patterns are representative of the mantle
convection cases studied here and can be used as boundary conditions
for geodynamo models.
