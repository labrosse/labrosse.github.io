Daniela Bolr√£o's paper, co-authored by Maxim Ballmer, Adrien Morison,
Antoine Rozel, Patrick Sanan, Paul Tackley and myself has been
submitted to EGU's *Solid Earth*. This paper studies the timescale for
compositional equilibration between the solid mantle and magma oceans
above (TMO), below (BMO) or both, as function of the phase change
and Rayleigh numbers. You can read the paper and contribute to the
discussion on the 
[journal's webpage](https://www.solid-earth-discuss.net/se-2020-49).
