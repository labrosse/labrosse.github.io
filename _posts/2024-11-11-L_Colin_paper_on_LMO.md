The energy of the giant impact was large enough to generate an
initially fully molten Moon. During the solidification of this lunar
magma ocean (LMO), an anorthosite crust formed by flotation of light
anorthite crystals. Lunar anorthosites show crystallization ages as
young as 4.360 Gyr, suggesting a long-lived LMO or a rather young
Moon. Existing models for LMO solidification are for a specific phase
diagram based on one compositional model. However, the LMO
solidification timescale depends on the lunar bulk composition and on
the appearance of anorthite in the crystallization sequence. 

Here, we propose a physically robust 1D model for LMO evolution based
on a simple anorthite/olivine-pyroxene eutectic phase
diagram. Cumulates first settle at the ocean base for about a thousand
years. This first stage results in an unstable thermal profile for the
cumulates that can lead to their overturn. In the second stage,
simultaneous crystallization of anorthite and cumulates leads to the
formation of a buoyant lid that considerably slows down LMO cooling.

We explore the impact of an initially hydrated composition, which
reduces the stability of plagioclase, of the eutectic position and of
the crust thermal conductivity. We show that cumulates overturn may
reduce or extend the LMO solidification time depending on its
duration. The total LMO solidification timescale ranges between 45 and
250 Myr. Given the most reliable age of 4.360 Gyr for FAN sample
60025, which derives from more than 99% of crystallization, we
estimate an age of 4400 to 4560 Myr for the Moon.
