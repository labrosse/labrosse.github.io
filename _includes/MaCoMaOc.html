Solid state convection can take place in the rocky or icy mantles of
  planetary objects and these mantles can be surrounded above or below
  or both by molten layers of similar composition. A flow toward the
  interface can proceed through it by changing phase. This behaviour
  is modeled by a boundary condition  taking into account the competition between viscous
    stress in the solid, that builds topography of the interface with
    a timescale &tau;<sub>&eta;</sub>, and convective transfer of the latent
    heat in the liquid from places of the boundary where freezing
    occurs to places of melting, which acts to erase topography, with
    a timescale &tau;<sub>&phi;</sub>. The ratio &Phi;=&tau;<sub>&phi;</sub>/&tau;<sub>&eta;</sub>  controls
  whether the boundary condition is the classical non-penetrative one
  (&Phi;&rarr;&infin;) or allows for a finite flow through the
  boundary (small &Phi;). We study Rayleigh-B&eacute;nard convection in a
  plane layer subject to this boundary condition at either or both its
  boundaries using linear and weakly non-linear analyses. When both
  boundaries are phase change interfaces with equal values of &Phi;,
  a non-deforming translation mode is possible with a critical
  Rayleigh number equal to 24&Phi;. At small values of &Phi;, this
  mode competes with a weakly deforming mode having a slightly lower
  critical Rayleigh number and a very long wavelength,
  &lambda;<sub>c</sub>&sim;8&radic;(2)&pi;/ 3&radic;(&Phi;). Both modes lead to very
  efficient heat transfer, as expressed by the relationship between
  the Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers. When only one boundary is subject
  to a phase change condition, the critical Rayleigh number is
  <i><em>Ra</em></i><sub>c</sub>=153 and the critical wavelength is &lambda;<sub>c</sub>=5. The
  Nusselt number increases about twice faster with Rayleigh number
  than in the classical case with non-penetrative conditions and the
  average temperature diverges from 1/2 when the Rayleigh number is
  increased, toward larger values when the bottom boundary is a phase
  change interface.

 Crystallization of a compositionally stratified basal magma ocean.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Earth's &sim;3.45 billion year old magnetic field is regenerated by dynamo action in its convecting liquid metal outer core. However, convection induces an isentropic thermal gradient which, coupled with a high core thermal conductivity, results in rapid conducted heat loss. In the absence of implausibly high radioactivity or alternate sources of motion to drive the geodynamo, the Earth's early core had to be significantly hotter than the melting point of the lower mantle. While the existence of a dense convecting basal magma ocean (BMO) has been proposed to account for high early core temperatures, the requisite physical and chemical properties for a BMO remain controversial. Here we relax the assumption of a well-mixed convecting BMO and instead consider a BMO that is initially gravitationally stratified owing to processes such as mixing between metals and silicates at high temperatures in the core-mantle boundary region during Earth's accretion. Using coupled models of crystallization and heat transfer through a stratified BMO, we show that very high temperatures could have been trapped inside the early core, sequestering enough heat energy to run an ancient geodynamo on cooling power alone.
