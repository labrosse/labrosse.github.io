<blockquote><font size="-1">
The  presence of a magma ocean may have characterized the beginning of 
terrestrial planets and, depending on how the solidification has proceeded,
the solid mantle may have been in contact with a magma ocean at its
upper boundary, its lower boundary, or both, for some period of
time. At the interface where the solid is in contact with the liquid the matter 
can flow through by changing phase, and this affects convection in
the solid during magma ocean crystallization.
Linear and weakly non linear analyses have shown that Rayleigh-B&eacute;nard flow 
subject to two liquid-solid phase change boundary conditions is characterized by a 
non-deforming translation or weakly deforming long wavelength mode
at relatively low Rayleigh number. Both modes are
expected to transfer heat very efficiently, at least in the range of applicability
of weakly non-linear results for the deforming mode. When only one
boundary is a phase change, the critical Rayleigh number is also reduced,
by a factor of about 4, and the heat transfer is also greatly
increased. In this study we use direct numerical simulations in two-dimensional 
Cartesian geometry to explore how the solid convection may be affected
by these boundary conditions for values of the Rayleigh number extending
beyond the range of validity of the weakly non-linear
results, up to 10<sup>3</sup> times the critical value. Our results suggest that solid 
state convection during magma ocean crystallization may have been
characterized by a very efficient mass and heat transfer, with
a heat flow and velocity at the least twice the value previously thought when only
one magma ocean is present, above or below. In the situation with a magma
ocean above and below, we show that the convective heat flow through the solid
  layer could reach values of
  the same order as that of the black-body radiation at the surface
  of the magma ocean.

 Timescale of overturn in a magma ocean cumulate.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The formation and differentiation of planetary bodies are thought to involve magma oceans stages. We study the case of a planetary mantle crystallizing upwards from a global magma ocean. In this scenario, it is often considered that the magma ocean crystallizes more rapidly than the time required for convection to develop in the solid cumulate. This assumption is appealing since the temperature and composition profiles resulting from the crystallization of the magma ocean can be used as an initial condition for convection in the solid part. We test here this assumption with a linear stability analysis of the density profile in the solid cumulate as crystallization proceeds. The interface between the magma ocean and the solid is a phase change interface. Convecting matter arriving near the interface can therefore cross this boundary via melting or freezing. We use a semi-permeable condition at the boundary between the magma ocean and the solid to account for that phenomenon. The timescale with which convection develops in the solid is found to be several orders of magnitude smaller than the time needed to crystallize the magma ocean as soon as a few hundreds kilometers of cumulate are formed on a Mars- to Earth-size planet. The phase change boundary condition is found to decrease this timescale by several orders of magnitude. For a Moon-size object, the possibility of melting and freezing at the top of the cumulate allows the overturn to happen before complete crystallization. The convective patterns are also affected by melting and freezing at the boundary: the linearly most-unstable mode is a degree-1 translation mode instead of the approximately aspect-ratio-one convection rolls found with classical non-penetrative boundary conditions. The first overturn of the crystallizing cumulate on Mars and the Moon could therefore be at the origin of their observed degree-1 features.

 Chemical convection and stratification in the Earth's outer core.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Convection in the Earth's outer core is driven by buoyancy sources of both thermal and compositional origin. The thermal and compositional molecular diffusivities differ by several orders of magnitude, which can affect the dynamics in various ways. So far, the large majority of numerical simulations have been performed within the codensity framework that consists in combining temperature and composition, assuming artificially enhanced diffusivities for both variables. 
In this study, we use a particle-in-cell method implemented in a 3D dynamo code to conduct a first qualitative exploration of pure compositional convection in a rotating spherical shell. We focus on the end-member case of infinite Schmidt number by totally neglecting the compositional diffusivity.
We show that compositional convection has a very rich physics that deserves several more focused and quantitative studies. We also report, for the first time in numerical simulations, the self-consistent formation of a chemically stratified layer at the top of the shell caused by the accumulation of chemical plumes and blobs emitted at the bottom boundary. When applied to likely numbers for the Earth's core, some (possibly simplistic) physical considerations suggest that a stratified layer formed in such a scenario would be probably weakly stratified and may be compatible with magnetic observations.

 Rayleigh-B&eacute;nard convection in a creeping solid with a phase
  change at either or both horizontal boundaries.
 <em>J. Fluid Mech.</em>, 846:5&ndash;36, 2018.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Solid state convection can take place in the rocky or icy mantles of
  planetary objects and these mantles can be surrounded above or below
  or both by molten layers of similar composition. A flow toward the
  interface can proceed through it by changing phase. This behaviour
  is modeled by a boundary condition  taking into account the competition between viscous
    stress in the solid, that builds topography of the interface with
    a timescale &tau;<sub>&eta;</sub>, and convective transfer of the latent
    heat in the liquid from places of the boundary where freezing
    occurs to places of melting, which acts to erase topography, with
    a timescale &tau;<sub>&phi;</sub>. The ratio &Phi;=&tau;<sub>&phi;</sub>/&tau;<sub>&eta;</sub>  controls
  whether the boundary condition is the classical non-penetrative one
  (&Phi;&rarr;&infin;) or allows for a finite flow through the
  boundary (small &Phi;). We study Rayleigh-B&eacute;nard convection in a
  plane layer subject to this boundary condition at either or both its
  boundaries using linear and weakly non-linear analyses. When both
  boundaries are phase change interfaces with equal values of &Phi;,
  a non-deforming translation mode is possible with a critical
  Rayleigh number equal to 24&Phi;. At small values of &Phi;, this
  mode competes with a weakly deforming mode having a slightly lower
  critical Rayleigh number and a very long wavelength,
  &lambda;<sub>c</sub>&sim;8&radic;(2)&pi;/ 3&radic;(&Phi;). Both modes lead to very
  efficient heat transfer, as expressed by the relationship between
  the Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers. When only one boundary is subject
  to a phase change condition, the critical Rayleigh number is
  <i><em>Ra</em></i><sub>c</sub>=153 and the critical wavelength is &lambda;<sub>c</sub>=5. The
  Nusselt number increases about twice faster with Rayleigh number
  than in the classical case with non-penetrative conditions and the
  average temperature diverges from 1/2 when the Rayleigh number is
  increased, toward larger values when the bottom boundary is a phase
  change interface.

 Crystallization of a compositionally stratified basal magma ocean.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Earth's &sim;3.45 billion year old magnetic field is regenerated by dynamo action in its convecting liquid metal outer core. However, convection induces an isentropic thermal gradient which, coupled with a high core thermal conductivity, results in rapid conducted heat loss. In the absence of implausibly high radioactivity or alternate sources of motion to drive the geodynamo, the Earth's early core had to be significantly hotter than the melting point of the lower mantle. While the existence of a dense convecting basal magma ocean (BMO) has been proposed to account for high early core temperatures, the requisite physical and chemical properties for a BMO remain controversial. Here we relax the assumption of a well-mixed convecting BMO and instead consider a BMO that is initially gravitationally stratified owing to processes such as mixing between metals and silicates at high temperatures in the core-mantle boundary region during Earth's accretion. Using coupled models of crystallization and heat transfer through a stratified BMO, we show that very high temperatures could have been trapped inside the early core, sequestering enough heat energy to run an ancient geodynamo on cooling power alone.
