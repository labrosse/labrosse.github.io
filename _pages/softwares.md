I use, contribute to the development of, or design several softwares for my research, most being
accessible on [github](https://github.com/).

* StagYY: The convection code StagYY is the property of [Paul
  J. Tackley](http://jupiter.ethz.ch/~pjt/index.html) and ETH
  Zürich. The code is not (yet) freely accessible but can provided on demand from
  Paul Tackley.
* [StagPy](https://github.com/StagPython/StagPy) is a python suite to
  plot results from StagYY (fields, profiles, time series). It can be used as a command line or from a
  python script. Started with
  [Martina Ulvrova](https://mulvrova.github.io/about.html), the main current developer is
  [Adrien Morison](https://adrienmorison.com/about/).
* [ministag](https://github.com/StagPython/ministag) is a 2D
  thermal convection code written in python written with [Adrien Morison](https://adrienmorison.com/about/).
* [dmsuite](https://github.com/labrosse/dmsuite) is a python port of a
  package originally written for matlab by Weidemann and Reddy. It
  calculates spectral collocation differentiation matrices.
* [StabLinRB](https://github.com/labrosse/StabLinRB) uses
  [dmsuite](https://github.com/labrosse/dmsuite) to solve the linear
  stability of Rayleigh-Bénard convection for various boundary
  conditions.
